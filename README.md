## Features

- üîç Scan ports quickly with multithreading  
- üß† Validates hostnames and IP addresses  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Reads config from `config_inquisitor.txt` (port range, timeout, threads)  
- üìÑ Clean and modular codebase ready to grow  

## Current Toolset

- **Port Scanner**  
  A fast and customizable port scanner with thread control and timeout settings. Useful for recon, auditing, and testing open ports on any target.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Make sure `config_inquisitor.txt` exists and has values like:
    ```
    timeout=0.7  
    max_threads=100  
    start_port=1  
    end_port=100
    ```
3. Run:
    ```bash
    python scanner.py
    ```

## Planned Tools

- Banner grabber  
- Hash identifier  
- Directory brute-forcer  
- IP geolocator  
- WHOIS lookup  
- Reverse DNS  
- Future: Exploit suggestions based on open ports
