#inquisitor

INQUISITOR is a universal cybersecurity toolkit for professionals, designed to be modular, fast, and easy to expand. Its first tool, a powerful multi-threaded port scanner, helps users quickly assess network targets and learn about common vulnerabilities.
Features

    üîç Multi-threaded port scanning for speed
    üß† Validates hostnames and IP addresses
    ‚öôÔ∏è Reads config from config_inquisitor.txt (port range, timeout, threads)
    üõ†Ô∏è Modular design for future tools
    üìù Displays open ports with descriptions and common vulnerabilities

Current Toolset

    Port Scanner
        Fast and customizable scanning with thread and timeout control
        Takes an IP or domain as input
        Prints out open ports, a brief description for each, and common vulnerabilities associated with those ports

How to Use

    Clone the repo:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/bmp-43/INQUISITOR.git
cd INQUISITOR

Make sure config_inquisitor.txt exists with values like:
Code

timeout=0.7
max_threads=100
start_port=1
end_port=100

Run the toolkit:
bash

    python3 inquisitor.py

    Select the tool you want to use (currently only Port Scanner is available).
    When prompted, enter the IP address or domain you want to scan.
    View the list of open ports, each with a description and info about common vulnerabilities.
